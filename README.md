Flight Core integration/staging tree
=====================================


What is Flight?
----------------

Flight is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. It uses a peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Flight Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

This digital currency is being developed to support the raising cost of flight training
around the world both by offering scholarships and the potential planned non-profit flight
school(s).

Development Process
-------------------

The `main` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/flight-myppl/flight/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of flight Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).


Testing
-------
We are currently still doing a lot of testing and code modifications before we suggest any committed nodes and mining.  More to follow.


### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
